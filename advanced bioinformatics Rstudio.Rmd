## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Task1
```{r}
sum(seq(5,55))
```

Task2:function called sumfun with one input parameter, called n, that calculates the sum of all integers between 5 and n. 
```{r}
sumfun <-function(n)sum(seq(5,n))

sumfun(10)
sumfun(20)
sumfun(100)
```

```
Task3The famous Fibonacci series is calculated as the sum of the two preceding members of the sequence, where the first two steps in the sequence are 1, 1. Write an R script using a for loop to calculate and print out the first 12 entries of the Fibonacci series. 
```{r}
```{r}
length =(12)
vals <- numeric(length)
vals[1] <- 1
vals[2] <- 1
for(n in 3:length) { vals[n] <- vals[n-1] + vals[n-2] }
vals
```

```

Task4
 With the mtcars dataset bundled with R, use ggplot to generate a box of miles per gallon (in the variable mpg) as a function of the number of gears (in the variable gear). 
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x= as.factor(gear), y= mpg)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill= as.factor(gear) )) + ggtitle(" Box plot of Miles per gallon(mpg) as a function of gears")

```

Task5
```{r}
y <- cars $dist; x <- cars $speed; 
model <- lm(formula = "y ~ x")
summary(model)
```
Task 6:
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot_1.0 <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x= speed, y=dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = "y ~ x")

ggplot_1.1 <- ggplot_1.0 + ggtitle ("Linear model of the relationship between breaking distance(dist) and speed")+ xlab("speed(milesperhour)")+ ylab("dist(feet)")
ggplot_1.1
```
